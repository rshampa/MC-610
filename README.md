# Medicinal Chemistry (MC-610)

This post-graduate-level course was given in the academic year 2020-2021 at NIPER Hyderabad. This course offers in-silico drug design techniques.

This repository contains lecture slides from the part of lecture series given by me (remaining parts were covered by Dr. Gopalakrishnan Bulusu and his co-workers).

My part was outlined with the following modules:

## Electronic structure methods and applications

### Potential energy surface and minimization

### Electronic structure theories

  - Wavefunction based methods
  - Semi-empirical methods
  - Density functional theory

### Applications (QM methods in practice)

Many thanks to [Prof. Jay Ponder](https://dasher.wustl.edu) for his inspiring lecture materials.
